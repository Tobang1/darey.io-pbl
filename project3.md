# Project  WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (MERN STACK)

# MongoDB ExpressJS ReactJS and NodeJS

## Backend COnfiguration with NODEJS.

### as usual i connected to my ec2 instances. did and update and upgrade on the server using sudo apt update && upgrade

### So i downloaded the node js repository using curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash - 
### The i installed it using (sudo apt-get install -y nodejs) and checked the node using (node -v) and (npm -v) which is the package manager for installing node packages and dependencies.

### i created a new directory (mkdir Todo) and navigate to the directory (cd Todo).
###  Then i initialize the project in the Todo direcory using (npm init) and accepted the default values and write out the file package.json.

### then i used ls to check in the Todo folder if my package.json file is created.

## ExpressJS Installation

### i used npm to install the express.js  (npm install express)
### then created a file index.js, then install dotenv module using (npm install dotenv)
### i inserted a code into the .=index.js file using vim editor. its a server configuration thats pinting to port 5000 and listening to port 5000 as well which i opened on my ec2 instance security group.
## then i used node index.js to check if my index,js file is connected to port 5000. and i checked it on web browser http://ip/5000 on port 5000

## ROUTES
### The todo list need to use an end point HTTP request method of POST, GET and DELETE method.
### First we make new directory (mkdir routes)
### change directory to the routes (cd routes)
### create a file in the folder and name it api.js then copied the connection router code to the file and write it on the file. 

## Models and installation of MONGODB

## first install mongoose inside the Todo directory using npm package (npm install mongoose)

###  we need to create and navigate to models directory (mkdir models && cd models)'
### create a file named todo.js and open the todo.js file using vim
### then i copied the connection code to the todo.js file write and saved it
### i updated the api.js file with new code i copied from the page by mapping out the model directory and router.

## INSTALATION OF MONGODB DATABASE

### First i created a new database on mLab as services solution and i selected shared cluster free account and AWS as service provider.
### i allowed access to the database from anywhere as for testing and changed the time frame from 6hrs to 1week.
### I created a MongoDB database on the mlab patform and coppied my cluster connection data so i can connect i used the node.js collection string.

## Back to the server
### I created and opened a new file in my Todo directory and named it .env  then i paste the connection string copied from the mlab db cluster collection into the .env fileand saved it in it

### Then io updated my index.js file to reflect the use of .env file so the node can connect to the mlab database.
### i used vim to edit it and pasted the code into the file index.js 

### then i start my server with (node index.js and database was successfully connected)

## RESTFUL API 
## POSTMAN this is a resful api development that is used to test API.

## INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION OF POSTMAN
### I downloaded and install postman software on my machine  then i created a POST request to the Api and set my header key content-Type as application/json
### Then created a GET rquest api request to get records from the database and sent it as a response to GET request.

## Front end creation. (this is the part that will be shown on the web browser)

### FIrst in my Todo directory used npx create-react-app client to scrfold the app which created a folder called client which is the place i added all my react code
## RNUUNING THE REACT APP 
### First i need to install all dependencies that reacts need to use to run or app ( npm install concurrently --save-dev) (npm install nodemon --save-dev) the nodemon is used to monitor the server also used to restart theserver if there are changes in the code.
### i changed some code in the package.json file in the Todo folder ("scripts": {"start": "node index.js","start-watch": "nodemon index.js","dev": "concurrently \"npm run start-watch\" \"cd client && npm start\""},) and saved it.

### Next i configured the package.json proxy.
## i cd to the client directory, used vim to edit my package.json file
###  Then i added a key value pair to the package.json file proxy using ("proxy": "http://localhost:5000".)
 
 ### Then i checked if im in the right directory which is Todo directory and i run  (npm run dev) and it shows app is running on localhost:3000. then i opened the port in my ec2 security group to port 3000

 ## Creating the react component
### in my todo app i cd to client directory and cd to src directory, in src directory i make another directory called components (mkdir components) and cd into the components directory (cd components)
###  I created 3 seperate files named Input.js, ListTodo.js and Todo.js respectively. (touch Input.js ListTodo.js Todo.js).
### then copied the code into the Input.js file.
### then i cd into the clients folder and install axios in the folder using (npm install axios)
### then cd back to the src/component folder and opend the ListTodo.js file copied and paste the react code into it, saved it.
### edited my Todo,js and paste the react code in it also.
### Cd back to my src folder and edited the App.js file by pasting the react code in it
### Also editied the App.css file and pasted the css code in it
### I did edited the index.css file also 
### Then cd back to the Todo folder (cd ../..)
### and ran npm run dev
### checked my app on http://localhost:3000 port 3000 and it was sucessfull


## PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED 
### The probelem i encounter was that i copied the index.css code into app.css code which i knew after 3 attempt of rebuilding the new server.
