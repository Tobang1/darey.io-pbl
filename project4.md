# MEAN STACK DEVPLOYMENT TO UBUNTU IN AWS
# MongoDB Express Angular Nodejs

## Setting up Ubuntu server
### as usual i created a new ec2 instance and connected to my ec2 instances. did and update and upgrade on the server using sudo apt update && upgrade

## NodeJs installation.

### i installed nodeJs with (sudo apt install -y nodejs)

## MongoDB installation

### First i downloaded the key using (sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 0C49F3730359A14518585931BC711F9BA15703C6)
### and echo the deb file from the repository using (echo "deb [ arch=amd64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu trusty/mongodb-org/3.4 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.4.list)

### Then install the mongod using (sudo apt install -y mongodb)
### i did start the mongodb sever (sudo servece mongodb start)
### Then checked the status of my server if its running using (sudo systemctl status mongodb ) which is running
### next i installed the node package manager npm (sudo apt install -y npm)
### also installed the body-paser a node package that process json files request. (sudo npm install body-parser)

## Creation of the server folder and configuration
### i created the server and cd in into the  folder named books (mkdir Books && cd Books)
### I intialize npm in the books folder (npm init )
### Then created a file named server.js (vim server.js ) and copied the webserver code into it (var express = require('express');
#### var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
#### var app = express();
#### app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
#### app.use(bodyParser.json());
#### require('./apps/routes')(app);
#### app.set('port', 3300);
#### app.listen(app.get('port'), function() {
#### console.log('Server up: http://localhost:' + app.get('port'));
#### });)

## EXPRESS AND MONGOOSE INSTALATION
### I installed express using (sudo npm install express mongoose)
### Then in the Book folder i created a new directory folder named apps then cd into the apps folder (mkdir apps && cd apps)
### i creates a new file named routes.js and pasted the code into it( its the json code)
### Then in the apps folder i created a folder named models and cd into the folder models (mkdir models && cd models)
### in the models folder i created a new file named book.js which will hold the connection code for the mongoosedb connections

## ACCESSING THE ROOT WITH ANGULARJS
### I cd back into the Books directory and created a folder called public also cd into the public folder (mkdir public && cd public)
### Then, i created a new file called script.js did a copy and pate the controller configuration code for angular into the script.js
### I then create a file called index.htm in the public folder and pasted an html web cod into the file index.html
### then i cd back into the books directory. (cd.. )
### I did start my sever using (node server.js)
### Then i checked my server is connected  on localhost port 3300 using (curl -s http://localhost:3300)
### also added and opened the port fot 3300 in my ec2 inbound security rules
### then i checked my server on web browser using (http://ip:3300)
### and i added a new register 

# PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED
### The problem i encountered was i forgot to open the port 3300 and was thinking why my webpage isnt loading port 3300 then i did. also i updated my ufw for port 3300. It was great finding the solution to it.
